## 🚀 **Getting Started**

> ⚠️ **Important Virtual Environment Warning**  
> Many projects in this repository require specific dependencies and libraries. Before running any project, it's **highly recommended** to create and activate a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with your system Python installation and ensure all dependencies are properly isolated.

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (helpful but not required)

### **Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chariszach/100day_Python_course.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd 100day_Python_course

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac:
source myenv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# myenv\Scripts\activate

# Install required dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Running Projects**
Each project is self-contained in its respective folder:

```bash
# Example: Running the Snake Game
cd "Intermidiate-/Snake Game"
python main.py

# Example: Running the Blackjack Game
cd "Day10-Day14/Blackjack"
python main-blackjack.py
```
